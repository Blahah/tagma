# tagmoscope

From the Ancient Greek τάγμα (tágma, “something which has been ordered or arranged”) and σκοπέω (skopeō, "I look at").

The organisational tool I've always wanted, but haven't been able to find.

Features it should eventually have:

- projects and tasks
  - can be assigned guilt - there's a button or something to increment the guilt for an item. Intuition: "how often do I feel bad for not having done this?"
  - can be assigned priors or weights - a numerical or categorical field. Intution: "how important do I *think* this is?"
  - timing
    - complex frequencies (e.g. at least twice a week, every day, once a month on the 6th, etc.)
    - deadlines
    - durations (i.e. estimated time the work will take)
- views
  - high level view across all projects - perhaps as a mind map
  - tasks
    - kanban board (overall or per project)
    - list (overall or per projects)
    - can be filtered or ranked by 'stagnation' or conversely` 'activity'
    - can be filtered or ranked by 'guilt'
    - can display items from one or many projects
    - calendar view, showing work done in the past, and impending deadlines and end dates
  - data dashboard
    - tasks completed over time (overall and per project)
    - projects by activity (some visual marker of the relative activity on projects)
    - some way of visualising how thinking changes over time (NLP analysis of task descriptions?)
    - times completed vs missed for deadlines, durations and repetitions, total or over time
- other
  - sync with github issues
